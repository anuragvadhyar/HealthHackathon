### Project Summary

The project consists of two main parts: a website named "Womenopause" designed to provide information and support for women going through menopause, and an associated chatbot for e-therapy, intended to offer a conversational interface for users seeking help or information.

#### Part 1: Womenopause Website

**Purpose:**
The "Womenopause" website aims to educate and support women experiencing menopause by providing information on symptoms, mental health impacts, diet plans, meditation practices, yoga poses, and access to e-therapy.

**Implementation Details:**
1. **HTML Structure:**
    - The main HTML file (`index.html`) sets up the website structure, including the sidebar navigation, main content area, and various sections such as Healthy Diet Plan, Meditation, Yoga, and Contact.
    - The sidebar provides easy navigation to different sections of the website.
    
2. **CSS Styling:**
    - The website uses external CSS from W3.CSS and Google Fonts (Poppins).
    - Inline CSS styles are applied for specific elements like the sidebar, images, and modal gallery.

3. **JavaScript Functionality:**
    - The script handles sidebar open/close functionality and a modal image gallery for displaying full-size images.

4. **Content:**
    - The website contains detailed sections on menopause symptoms, diet plans, meditation, yoga poses, and contact information for e-therapy.
    - Each section provides comprehensive information to help users manage menopause effectively.

#### Part 2: E-Therapy Bot

**Purpose:**
The "E-Therapy Bot" (accessible through `botpage.html`) provides a conversational interface where users can interact with a chatbot to get support and information related to menopause.

**Implementation Details:**
1. **HTML Structure:**
    - The `botpage.html` file sets up the chat interface, including a header, main chat area, and input area for user messages.
    - The chat interface uses a simple and clean design for ease of use.

2. **CSS Styling:**
    - The chat interface is styled using an external CSS file (`style.css`) to provide a modern and user-friendly look.
    - The chat bubbles, message input area, and other elements are styled to enhance the user experience.

3. **JavaScript Functionality:**
    - The `main.js` file contains the JavaScript code to handle user input, display messages, and manage the chat flow.
    - The bot initially greets the user and waits for their response to start a conversation.

**Integration:**
- A link on the main website (`index.html`) redirects users to the chatbot page (`botpage.html`), making it easy for users to switch from reading information to interacting with the chatbot.
